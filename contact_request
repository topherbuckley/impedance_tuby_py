@mrstibbons, I'm working on a similar project right now and wondered if you had any example test signals available for debugging purposes?

I'm building the code for a friend who is building an impedance tube and would like to test the software out with some recorded signals. 

Please contact me at info@omnyacoustics.com if possible. 

Cheers,
